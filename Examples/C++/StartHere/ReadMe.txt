all files that start with MY* are generated output.  They are not necessary.


The entire example is is StartHere.cpp


If you place this example in the [XMLFoundation\Examples\C++\StartHere] folder
then the library and include paths will be correct in the .dsp file.

build the XMLFoundation first then type

make -f makefile.linux
