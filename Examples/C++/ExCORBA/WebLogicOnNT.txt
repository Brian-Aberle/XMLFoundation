Before you try to compile this example make sure you have
an environment that can build the Weblogic CORBA examples.

open 2 command windows.

Do the following in both of them:
---------------------------------
move the current directory to
cd C:\bea\tuxedo\samples\corba\simpapp

Find you install of VC++, and run the vcvars32.bat file for example:
...>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\vcvars32"

use the quotes if you have spaces in your path.

type this at your command prompt
set TUXDIR=c:\bea\tuxedo

run the runme batch file:
C:\bea\tuxedo\samples\corba\simpapp>runme


get the example to work in both command windows.

run the simple_server in one command window.
run the simple_client in another.

The server should uppercase any string you send to it.

Kill the simple_Server. (Task Manager is the only way I found)


move each command window to the \XMLFoundation\Examples\c++\ExCORBA
directory.  Move one down to server, and the other down to client.
in each command window:

c:\>nmake -f makeifle.nt.weblogic

Run the server, Run the client.
