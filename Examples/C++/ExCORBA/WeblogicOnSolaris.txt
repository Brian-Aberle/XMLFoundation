Install Weblogic, then Tuxedo in the base dir [/bea]
** If you do not install in [/bea] location, then
you will have to modify the file makefile.nt.weblogic
to use the paths specific to your install.




Before you try to compile this example make sure you have
an environment that can build the Weblogic CORBA examples.
