// char chUniqueOverload is not used, it's purpose is so that this memory overload does not 
// cause link conflicts with other memory tools like that from MicroQuill or the overloaded new
// within MFC.
//
// This may be used to find memory leaks by entering every alloc in a list or hash then removing it when it is free'd
// anything left over is technically a memory leak, however not all leaks are bad.  Bad leaks grow
// during the course of the application.  Good leaks are one time allocations that never grow and they are never
// released when the application shuts down because there is no real purpose since the process is ending and the process
// memory will be released by the operating system.
//
//
// This was added to find performance errors, such as adding 1Meg into a GString that was never pre-allocated.
// Such an error will cause the GString to alloc many times over and over until it has grown to the needed size.
// Calling GString::PreAlloc(1024000) will be much faster, and this handy overload will help you find such errors.
