	// Here's C++ at it's finest.  The private constructor forbids construction
	// privilege at compile time.  The only exception to this rule is that members
	// of type XMLObjectFactoryManager may call private methods.  The static accessor
	// getFactoryManager() is a member method.  In this method a static instance
	// of XMLObjectFactoryManager is defined.  This alone is powerful, guaranteeing we will
	// never have > 1 instance of a FactoryManager.  (If it was public, an application
	// programmer could instantiate them).  
	
	// Now it's other purpose, even more important, is that this design pattern 
	// eliminates global race conditions. The XMLObjectFactoryManager is basically 
	// a global list of function pointers.  Each new object registers itself with a macro
	// that wrote another global object.  Obviously the list must be constructed 
	// before the first entry is added.  If they are both "global" there is no 
	// way to guarantee construction order.  By using the static member in a 
	// static method we guaranteed the construction order.
	
	// Additionally, XMLObjectFactoryManager once used GList to contain these items
	// however GList uses a custom memory management via a global object - the race conditions 
	// apply to the destructor as well.  In this case, only in one build the destructor of this
	// global class needed to iterate a GList - after all of the global GList::Nodes had been
	// released at application exit - while this global object contained a List that was no longer
	// connected by GList::Nodes which still contain a valid pointer that needs to be released
	// in the destructor of this object - now in the GArray we always have access to those valid pointers.
