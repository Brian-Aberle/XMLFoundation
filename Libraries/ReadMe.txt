There have been and likely will be supporting libraries that appear in this folder besides the XMLFoundation library.
This makes the path naming a bit redundant for the XMLFoundation library with the term XMLFoundation twice in the path 
there was a reason and likely will be a reason again therefore it remains although the redundancy is not necessary at the moment..
